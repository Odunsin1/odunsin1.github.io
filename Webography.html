    <h1>Computing in Arts</h1>
    <h2>by Nichole Odunsi</h2>
    <p>
        With the page what I have is me explaining what computer arts is. I also looked at the good and the bad of the art trying my best to not share my opinion so I said what the topics were about were basically explaining the history with 3D and 2D art. 3D art being three dimensional with examples being sculptures and architecture. With 2D being in the elements of traditional with examples being charcoal and sketches. There is also Digital art, where you are basically using a computer to draw then there is then there is kinetic where by definition it is moving objects. Finally talking about generative Art or Artificial Intelligence and the history and  definition of all of these.
